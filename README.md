## FAQ

### Will you add support for older PHP versions?

Never! This plugin will only works on [actively supported PHP versions](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php).

Don't use it on **end of life** or **security fixes only** PHP versions.

Note: Current version supports PHP 7.0 because wordpress.org svn pre-commit hook rejects PHP 7.1+ syntax. However, you should not use PHP 7.0 because [it has reached **end of life** since 10 January 2019](https://secure.php.net/eol.php).
